The use of the image has produced controversy because "Playboy" is sometimes considered as degrading towards women and the Lenna photo has been pointed to as an example of sexism in the sciences, reinforcing gender stereotypes. In a 1999 essay on reasons for the male predominance in computer science, applied mathematician Dianne OLeary wrote: "Suggestive pictures used in lectures on image processing ... convey the message that the lecturer caters to the males only. For example, it is amazing that the "Lena" pin-up image is still used as an example in courses and published as a test image in journals today." A 2012 paper on compressed sensing used a photo of the model Fabio Lanzoni as a test image to draw attention to this issue. The use of the test image at the magnet school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia engendered a guest editorial by a senior in The Washington Post in 2015 about its detrimental impact on aspiring female students in computer science: "I first saw a picture of Playboy magazines Miss November 1972 a year ago as a junior at TJ. My A.I. teacher told our class to search Google for Lena Soderberg (not the full image, though!) and use her picture to test our latest coding assignment. I tried to tune out the boys sexual comments. Why is an advanced science, technology, engineering and mathematics school using a Playboy centerfold in its classrooms?... As a result of TJs culture issue, some young women are deciding not to pursue upper-level computer science courses."
